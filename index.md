# DMRI head motion correction algorithms are highly accurate but affected by denoising and sampling scheme

*Head motion correction is particularly challenging in diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) scans due to the dramatic changes in image contrast at different gradient strengths and directions. Currently head motion correction is typically performed using a Gaussian Process model implemented in FSLâ€™s Eddy. Recently, the 3dSHORE-based SHORELine method was introduced to correct any non-single-shelled sequence. Here we perform a comprehensive evaluation of both methods on realistic simulations of a software fiber phantom and known ground-truth head motion. We demonstrate that both methods perform remarkably well, but that performance can be affected by sampling scheme, the pervasiveness of head motion and the denoising strategy applied before head motion correction.*
